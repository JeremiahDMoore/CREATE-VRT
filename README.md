# CREATE-VRT

Boilerplate template to get your Vite, React, Tailwind project set up quickly.
You have have 3 options to use this template. First is downloading the folder from github, second is cloning to local from github, and third (easiest) is using the package via "npx create-vrt 'your-app-name'".  I've provided instructions for all three.

### Using the NPM package (easiest way)

- First create or navigate to the folder you'll want to put your new app folder into.
- Next open up your terminal and run "npx create-vrt 'your-app-name'"
